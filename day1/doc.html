       <h1>Introduction of Javascript</h1>
       <p>>>> JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming <br>

          >>> It is mainly used to make web pages interactive and <br>

          >>> Along with HTML (structure) and CSS (styling), JavaScript is a core technology of the World Wide Web.</p>

    <div class="history">
        <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>
        <p><h2>1. Birth of JavaScript (1995)</h2> <br>

In 1995, Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications created JavaScript in just 10 <br>

Initially named Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.<br>

The name “JavaScript” was chosen for marketing reasons (Java was popular at that time), but Java and JavaScript are completely different languages.<br>

<h2>2. Early Adoption (1996–1999)</h2><br>

1996: Microsoft introduced JScript, its own version of JavaScript, for Internet Explorer.<br>

1997: JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International to create a standard.<br>

This standard was called ECMAScript (ES).<br>

1999: ECMAScript 3 (ES3) was released and became widely adopted.<br>

<h2>3. Dormant Years (2000–2008)</h2><br>

Little progress was made; browsers supported different features, causing compatibility issues.<br>

Developers relied heavily on jQuery to make JavaScript work across all browsers.<br>

<h2>4. Revival with V8 & Ajax (2008–2011)</h2><br>

2005: Ajax technology boosted interest by enabling dynamic, real-time web applications (like Google Maps & Gmail).<br>

2008: Google launched the V8 JavaScript Engine with Chrome, making JS much faster.<br>

2009: Node.js was introduced, allowing JavaScript to run on servers.<br>

<h2>5. Modern JavaScript Era (2015–Present)</h2><br>

2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ECMAScript 2015) was released with huge improvements like let, const, arrow functions, classes, promises, and modules.<br>

Since then, new ECMAScript versions (ES7, ES8, ES9, etc.) have been released annually with enhancements.<br>

JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Vue made modern web development faster and easier.<br>

<h2>6. Today</h2><br>

JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in web development.<br>

It powers both frontend (React, Angular, Vue) and backend (Node.js, Express.js) applications.<br>

With tools like React Native and Electron, JS also builds mobile apps and desktop apps.</p>
